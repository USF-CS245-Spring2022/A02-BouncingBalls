**How the code works:**  
This program recursively solves a Nonogram Puzzle (which must be a size within 9x9 and each row/column has no more than 2 sets of blocks (starting constraints).  

**Difficulties:**

## RollBounce  
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of lists and polymorphism, along with coding to an API in order to demonstrate a simulation of bouncing balls.  

## Background
This is a working starting point for a bouncing ball simulation in Java Swing / AWT. (When you compile and run this, you'll see two animated balls moving horizontally at different speeds. You may use this as the starting point to meet the assignment objective.)  

There are many online tutorials for implementing 2-dimensional animations in Java. Here are two:  
* [Create basic shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YhrmAGpVtI)  
* [Create simple animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3usNR8JrEE)  

These two tutorials are likely a sufficient primer for performing the tasks required by this assignment.  
You will use Java animations to simulate a number of bouncing balls on a two-dimensional canvas.
